# BrachyUMA21
Short Java programs to deal with Brachypodium distachyon ecotypes.

This project contains three programs to extract information from data files extracted from [Phytozome](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html). In particular:
* **es.uma.keyword.LookForKeyword**: Allows iterating through the fasta and gff3 files associated to several species and extract information related to a family of genes. Before working with this package, you have to download some files from Phytozome, configure some lines of source Java files and recompile. The program can be executed as is by means of the sample files already provided in the folder `"genomes/Phytozome/PhytozomeV13"`.
* **es.uma.html.GenerateSVG**: Takes as input the previously extracted data and generates an HTML file with the distribution of the genes. This file is specifically prepared to work with the 10 dehydrins found in *Brachypodium distachyon*. This program can be executed as is.
* **es.uma.motif.HTMLDecorator**: Iterates over a fasta file and converts it into an HTML file with highlighted motives. This program can be executed as is.

These programs are not intented to simply execute them but, instead, the code must be modified slightly if any developer wants to adapt to their needs. In any case, you need to clone this project by using the next command from any directory of your own:
```
git clone https://github.com/galvezuma/BrachyUMA21
cd BrachyUMA21
```
In the next sections are explained how to work with them.

## es.uma.keyword.LookForKeyword
This program uses as input an external structure of files that the user has to download from [Phytozome](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html). This has been tested in a case of use in which 54 ecotypes of *Brachypodium distachyon* have been downloaded. Before compilation, you have to change the line:
```Java
    private static final String DIR_NAME = "genomes/Phytozome/PhytozomeV13";
```
to adapt to your own directory that contains the files taken from Phytozome. In particular, you have to download the files with extension `.annotation_info.txt`, `.gene.gff3.gz`, `.protein_primaryTranscriptOnly.fa.gz` and `genes.fasta`. Please, note that the file `genes.fasta` is not in Phytozome and it must be generated by downloading also the `assembly` file from Phtyzome and executing additional programs and applications to extract genes from it (e.g., `gffread -x <out.fasta> -g <genome.fasta> <annotation.gff>`). In addition, the file `genomes/Order.txt` contains the order in which you want to generate the data on the extracted genes. Finally, the genes extracted are those that verify the sentences:
```Java
if (line.toUpperCase().contains("PF00257") || 
    line.toUpperCase().contains("DEHYDRIN")) { ...
```
By default this refers to the LEA2 gene family of Dehydrins whose PFAM code is PF00257. You have to modify these lines to adapt them to your needs. Genes are marked with different shapes according to the text found in it; this is done through the sentence:
```
String shape = line.toUpperCase().contains("PF00257")?"RECT":"TRIANGLE";
```
so a gene will be drawn as a square (PFAM code is found) or a triangle (PFAM code not found but, instead, a literal keyword) depending on its annotation in Phytozome.

Once these changes have been performed, compilation is carried by executing the next commands:
```
cd scr
javac es/uma/keyword/LookForKeyword.java
```
and executed using 
```
java es.uma.keyword.LookForKeyword
```
The result is displayed by console.

The file `datafiles/dehydrins_ecotypes.data` contains an example of the output of this program once executed over 54 ecotypes of *Brachypodium distachyon* downloaded from Phytozome. In addition, it is also given a file `datafiles/Order.txt` that refers to these 54 ecotypes.

## es.uma.html.GenerateSVG
This program uses the data extracted from the previous one (es.uma.keyword.LookForKeyword). As an example, a file `datafiles/dehydrins_ecotypes.data` is provided so you could run it from scratch. Compilation is carried by executing the next commands:
```
cd scr
javac es/uma/html/GenerateSVG.java
```
and executed using 
```
cd ..
java -cp ./src es.uma.html.GenerateSVG
```
This will display on console a trace of the genes processed and, in addition, a file `result.html` will be generated in the root directory; the order of the 54 ecotypes is also give by the file `datafiles/Order.txt`. Such a file has the next appearance:
![Dehydrins](images/DHN_Ecotypes.png?raw=true "Dehydrins")

## es.uma.motif.HTMLDecorator
This is a more general program very useful to colour motives in fasta files and to show the results in HTML. As an example, a file `datafiles/all_varieties_DHN_peptide.fasta` is provided so you could run it from scratch. It searches for 6 different motives, as can be seen in the next lines of the code:
```Java
    	StringBuilder sb =
    	process("datafiles/all_varieties_DHN_peptide.fasta",
    	                new PerfectMatchArgument[]{
    	                    new PerfectMatchArgument("EKKGIMDKIKEKLPG", "KSegment", 4),
    	                    new PerfectMatchArgument("VDEYGNP", "YSegment", 3),
    	                    new PerfectMatchArgument("EDDGQGR", "InterSegment", 2),
    	                    new PerfectMatchArgument("KKDKKKKKEKK", "NLSSegment", 2),
    	                    new PerfectMatchArgument("DRGLFDKFIGKK", "FSegment", 4), // For Brachypodium
    	                },
    	                new PatternArgument[]{
    	                    new PatternArgument(Pattern.compile("SSSS+"), "SSegment"),
    	                });
```
A search can be carried out by means of a regular Expression (`PatternArgument`) or by a perfect match of a given String (`PerfectMatchArgument`). In this last case, a third argument is added in order to specify how many mismatches we allow at most. The second argument of both `PatternArgument` and `PerfectMatchArgument` is a CSS class name used to colour the found motives. These CSS classes must appear in the file `resources/hubVarietiesDHN.html`; this HTML file is used as a skeleton to contain the result.

Compilation is carried by executing the next commands:
```
cd scr
javac es/uma/motif/HTMLDecorator.java
```
and executed using 
```
cd ..
java -cp ./src es.uma.motif.HTMLDecorator
```
This will display on console a trace of the motives found in each genes processed and, in addition, a file `DHNSegments.html` will be generated in the root directory. Such a file has the next appearance:
![Dehydrins](images/DHN_Segments.png?raw=true "Dehydrins")
